### What I'm doing ?
- when we have an invalid todo, we will have a dynamic class attached to the input element 
- learning and doing code for slots , what the slots are
- slots done, putting icons from iconify lib and customizing it 
- showing the todo items in stacked order and displaying the items todos into the textbox upon condition using v-if and v-else
- displaying the nice message if there is no todo item in the list
